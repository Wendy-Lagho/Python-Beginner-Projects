## Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors, where you play against the computer. Choose "rock," "paper," or "scissors," and the computer will randomly select its own choice. 
The game will then declare the winner based on the rules:
* Rock beats Scissors
* Scissors beats Paper
* Paper beats Rock
